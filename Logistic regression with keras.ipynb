To use logistic regression, we create a binary classification task by assigning the numbers below zero to one class, the numbers above to the other. This is a very easy task, because we can already formulate a rule for classification."

    "- We will always use the [sequential](https://keras.io/guides/sequential_model/) way of describing model architectures. There is another, somewhat more expressive way, the [functional](https://keras.io/guides/functional_api/) api. You might stumble upon examples in this notation on the internet.\n",
    "- In the exercises and examples, I always use `layers.Input(...)` as a first layer. This is not necessary, as the input shape can also be specified in the first \"real\" layer, with the argument `input_shape`. See documentation on the [input layer](https://keras.io/api/layers/core_layers/input/) for more details.\n",
    "- Models always need to be compiled before training. Thus, creating a model always consists of three steps:\n",
    "  1. Definition of the architecture (with a couple of `model.add(...)` commands), \n",
    "  2. Compiling the model. In this step, we also specify the loss function to use, and metrics to be displayed during training.\n",
    "  3. Fitting (i.e., training) the model. For this, we supply a few more arguments.\n",
    "- Getting the shape of the data right is not always trivial. To simplify development, one can always ask the model (with the current architecture) for its input and output shapes. This is done with the attributes `input_shape` and `output_shape`, respectively. See below for an example."
